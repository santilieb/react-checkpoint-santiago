# React checkpoint

This website is a responsive front-end project that uses the Fake Store API to populate the site
with fake products.
Specifically, it uses the axios package to perform GET requests to the query URL to get
data from the fake store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products).
The site contains a list of products, the user will be able to either save the products to the wishlist
or add them to the shopping bag. Clicking on both the wishlist or shopping bag icons will open
the respective menus.
